# MSA-project
This repository is for the MSA project of tech stream.

## Questions
* What are popular topics on Udemy? Why?
* Can a machine learn whether a given topics is popular on Udemy?

## Description
In this project, machine learning models will be built to find the answer for questions above. This project uses the Udemy Course dataset which is given in the Kaggle website (reference 1). With the first question, some procedures such as data analytic and natural language processing will be done. With the second question,  the classifier will be built, and the evaluation will be run to test/improve the accuracy of the classifier.

## Tasks
- [x] Clearning data
- [x] Feature engineering - Keep meaningful columns or aggregate new meaninful columns
- [ ] Generating statistical information for finding the definition of popularity.
- [ ] Generating topics for each course by using NLP
- [ ] Building a classifier
- [ ] Evaluating a classifier
